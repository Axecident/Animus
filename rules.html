							<h2>Rules</h2>
							<p>
								Here are the rules of Animus. Please follow them.
							</p>
						</header>
							<p>1. No abusing other members or any staff. Abuse-like jokes (banter) are allowed as long as the person you are directing them towards knows for <strong>certain</strong> it is a joke!</p>
                            <p>2. No being racist to anyone. Racist jokes can sometimes be allowed but only in voice channels. Where there are people you <strong>know</strong> will <strong>not</strong> get offended by them.</p>
                            <p>3. No exploiting <strong>any</strong> potentially rule breaking and/or annoying features of bots in Animus.</p>
                            <p>4. No ecchi and/or pornographic material of <strong>any</strong> kind is allowed except for in the NSFW channel.</p>
                            <p>5. No porn/ecchi material of girls/boys that look like little kids (despite what their age or boob/dick size is).</p>
                            <p>6. No disturbing or non pornographic/ecchi material is allowed in the NSFW channel.</p>
                            <p>7. No false reporting of someone breaking the rules.</p>
                            <p>8. No messaging developers for help with your problems. If you want to report a problem with the website or something else coding related. Please let a staff member (Moderator, Admin, Super Admin) know instead.</p>
                            <p>9. If you need help <strong>do not</strong> go to the highest staff member right away. Go to the <strong>lowest</strong> first (Moderator). If you cannot get in contact with them then go to an Admin and so on.</p>
                            <p>10. No spamming is allowed in any channel of Animus.</p>
                            <p>11. No "talking" to bots is allowed <strong>except</strong> for in the bot-talk channel.</p>
